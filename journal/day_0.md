* in my office, using my laptop. Starting with [this ubuntu based guide](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/how-to-kubernetes-cluster-on-raspberry-pi). I kinda wanted to use flatcar or fedora coreos or whatever, but I don't want to use them as much as I want to keep it simple.
* Choosing arm64, as the tutorial says that's what I need.
* Wrote the first 99% of the sd card in about 3 minutes, been hanging out at 99% for...awhile. (1915)
* there we go, just switched to verifying (1916). And done.
* ha ha, whoops. the pi's only take micro-sd and I bought full sized. :sad_trombone:. And the store is closed, so that wraps it up for today.
