Ok, don't think I'm gonna spend a lot of time on this today, but a few stabs.

[This fork](https://github.com/cbws/etcd-operator) was recommended as a possible replacement for the now defunct coreos etcd-operator. 

Ok, yeah, I didn't get any time, but the custom built images look like they're gonna work, but they have to be loaded into microk8s on each of the hosts OR ('cause i haven't tried yet), I might have to run a local registry.

Which will kinda suck, because then I'm gonna have to figure out persistent storage and I was hoping to kick that down the road a bit longer.
So here's hoping microk8s ctr works on worker nodes.
