Ok, just had to find out if the local image worked if you distribute it and load it on each node, and it does.

Ok, when I get back to this, I need to change the namespace 'cause running that in default...no.

Ok, added the namespace and grabbed. 

Ok, so the instructions have everything, but this day was a pain. And a lot of it isn't very replicable which is bad.

And tomorrow we get to find out if any of this actually works with coredns anyway.
